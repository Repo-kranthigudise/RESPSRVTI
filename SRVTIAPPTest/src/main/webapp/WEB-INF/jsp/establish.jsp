						<br /> <b>Bharat Sevak Samaj</b> <br> <br>Bharath Sevak
						Samaj is the National Development Agency sponsored by the Planning
						Commission, Government of India to ensure public co-operationfor
						implementing government plants. The main purpose behind the
						formulation of Bharat Sevak Samaj is to initiate a nation wide,
						non official and non political organization with the object of
						enabling individual citizens to contribute, in the form of an
						organized co-operative effort, to the implementation of the
						National Development Plan. The constitution and functioning of
						Bhart Sevak Samaj is approved unanimously by the Indian
						Parliament. <br> <br> <b>JAWAHARLAL NEHRU MESSAGE</b> <br>
						<br>We can to some extent measure our resources or most of
						them. But it is very difficult to measure the biggest of these
						resources that we have, that is man-power, and that psychology
						which makes people work for greater ends. Unless we utilize this
						man-power and unless we can produce that temper in our people
						which laughs at difficulties and gets things done, sometimes
						inspite of facts, we cannot achieve anything really big. <br>
						<br>The proposal to start organization to be called the
						Bharat Sevak Samaj, has this in view. It is an ambitions for it,
						not the ambition for little and personal things of life but the
						ambition to serve great causes, forgetting one self and achieve
						great ends. <br> <br>This is not a political
						organization, even though, I, a politician, commend it. It is
						meant for every able bodied men and women, whatever his views
						might be on other topics‚Äù. <br> <br> <b>A MISSION
							AND A MOVEMENT</b> <br> <br>Bharat Sevak Samaj is a mission
						and a movement. To succeed as such, it must win the adherence and
						support of a large and growing number of people in the country,
						that can come about only on the strengof a genuine understanding
						of the purpose and significance of the new organisation. To
						furnish an answer to the question: "Why Bhart Sevak Samaj"?, it
						shall restate the major assumption underlying the conception of
						the Samaj. <br> <br>First there is a great deal of
						necessary, good and useful work remain to be done in the aountry,
						for which no provision may be made, in the normal course, for many
						years. To accomplish this, special effort on a very large scale is
						needed, which is not yet in evidence. Scondly, the means for
						carrying out such a programme on a large scale are available in
						the shape of the unused time, energy and other resources,
						accompanied by the desire or urge on the part of may people to
						give for the service of the community. Thirdly, in view of the
						variety and magnitude of the activity, an organisation has to be
						built up, which has to be big and strong enough to cope with these
						great tasks. It should be capableof mobilizing the voluntary
						efforts of the people and make effective and fruitful use of it.
						Such organisation does not exist. <br> <br>In a
						community which has attainned such a state These basic assumptions
						explain the origin of the Bhart Sevak Samaj. Theyare as true and
						meaningful today as some years ago, whenthe first decision to
						establish the organisation was taken. The meaning may perphas,
						with advantage, be brought out a little more fully. <br> <br>In
						a community which has attained such a state of abundance that to
						everybody all the means of naterial well - being are available,
						voluntary service might not have a definite role. The view,
						however, does not take account of the vast tange of intagible
						service which, even in these circumstances, people can render to
						one another in the realm of moral and spiritual satisfaction. But
						that time has not yet come any where in any part of the world and
						is not likely to arrive in this country for many years. <br>
						<br>In fact, India, judging by her per capita income, stands
						almost at the bottom among the nations of the world. On the basis
						of available statistics India is lagging behind. There are thus
						bound to be large gaps in material well-being for the bulk of our
						people which should be visible to anyone who is in touch with the
						villages or the towns of India. <br> <br>Insanitary
						sorroundings, low standards of essential amenities, lack of
						facilities for community life in most places, are facts which
						themselves point to possibilities of constructive activity in
						numerous directions. Many of these things will, for the time
						being, not be figuting in the Governments's plants and are often
						beyond the reach of individual initative or resources. There are
						various other consequences of poverty and ignorance which must be
						combated by social enlightenment and action. In the field of
						social relations and the rebuilding of the social order, there are
						so many important task which are being neglected at present. <br>
						<br>At the same time, as all of us know, there are vast
						numbers of person who have unused or spareenergy and time at their
						disposal which could easily be directed into useful channels to
						fill many of these gaps. Take our villages; the normalavocations
						of the people and the claims of helthy recreation do not absorb
						all the time that is available. This idle time can, with the help
						of some auxiliary resources, be quickly converted into roads,
						tanks, community centres etc. <br> <br>If we assume that
						an hour a day on the average shoul thus be pressed into voluntary
						services in respect of half the population of the country, we can
						tap this reservior immensely for the betterment of nation.There
						are, besides, classes of people, who may have much more time to to
						give to useful volumntary activity if the idea appeals to them.
						There is a large class of those who have retired from service.
						They can bring to bear on this programme of voluntary activity a
						fund of experience. In this country there is also a fairly large
						number of those who renounce the world. As far as personal ends
						are concerned, but on the very account they are in a position to
						dedicate themselves wholly to the service of humanity. The
						vacation time of students could, in part, be utilized for social
						purposes. <br> <br>These large resources can, however,
						be drawn up actually only to the exent that the urge to seve
						others exists or can be created. It is our experience that the
						urge exists on a considerable scale, and amounts up to high levels
						when occasionsarise which make a strong appeal to the mind.
						Volunteers are not lacking in national emergencies. This urge for
						unselfish service is as much an abiding element of human nature as
						its self-regarding aspects. It can be nourished and strengthened.
						In our country which has just achieved Independence, mainly by
						dint of the sufferings and sacrifices of the common men and women.
						the spring of unselfish action is evidently there in plenty. There
						is also a good deal of impatience with the pace of our advance in
						talking the serious social and economic problems of the nation.
						The aspiration to make India a great and strong country is shared
						by vast numbers. These are counditions which offer wide
						opportunities for moving the hearts of the people, releasing their
						latent powers and enlisting them for the constructive task which
						are waiting to be done. Once this kind of climate and utlook are
						created, voluntary social service will rise high in the scale of
						priorities which are established in people's minds for the
						expenditure of their time and resources. Time which was supposed
						to be taken up in other pursuits, will now become free for acts of
						service. And not only time and talents, but also the material
						counterpart in cash and kind will be forthecoming in large
						measures. The poorest in our land have something to give by way of
						charity. <br> <br>These resources are there but no good
						can come out of them unless they are harnessed. Such large volumes
						of water flow in our mighty rivers are carried down to the sea
						without yielding the benefirts, which they can bring to the
						people. To prevent this waste, we have to make dams, reserviors
						and canals. The tapping of vast reserves of the nation's time and
						energy necessarily entails high feats of social engineering. An
						organisation, capable of dealing with the big tasks which arises,
						has to be set up. The tasks are many and varied. Programmes to
						meet national and local needs have to be worked our. They should
						be carried and explained to the people in every village and town
						of India. Voluntary effort has to be stimulated and mobilized on a
						nation-wide basis. Volunteers should be enlisted, traned and
						assigned suitable tasks. Leadership should be developed at various
						level by proper selection and courcses training. Equipment,
						technical guidance and various services have to be provided.
						Efficient and honest use has to be ensured of the resources
						available, whatever the source from which they are derived. There
						should be adequate supervision. A proper system of accounts,
						audit, records, Reports and returns should be brought into force.
						For this a network of agencies has to grow up, which should work
						on a decentralized basis but in a co-ordinated manner. When the
						number of those engaged in different activities grows and the
						atrea of operation extends, machinery at various levels has to be
						set up for taking decisions, issuing directions and securing
						observance of rules of discipline. In this entire set up
						precautions must be introduced so that standards of performance do
						not go down and the organisation is not undermined by tendencies
						to intrigues, factionalism and exploitation of any kind. When the
						idea of forming an organisation on these lines took shape, it was
						found that the functions set out here were not being discharged to
						any appreciable extend and no institution existed, which was
						designed to or capable of assuming respensibilities of this order.
						<br> <br>Bharat Sevak Samaj was thus brought into being.
						But it has been from the outset stressed that the formation of the
						Samaj should not lead to any duplication of efforts or overlapping
						of activities. All agencies working in this field should
						collaborate and by mutual help greatly enhance the range and
						effectiveness of the entire programme of constructive voluntary
						activity in the country. Samaj can become a focal centre for such
						collaboration. <br> <br> <b>Objects:</b> <br> <br>

							Principles for Part-Time Workers</b> <br> <br>Whereas
						Bharat Sevak Samaj in course of its existence of has followed its
						accepted principles of service and sacrifice in all its programmes
						and activities and has advanced considerably towards its
						objectives. It is felt that time come when Bharat Sevak Samaj
						should follow the following 5 principles of work: <br> <br>1.
						Obedience to all the rules of the organization as they are in
						force and as they will be from time to time. <br>2. Obedience
						to all lawful instructions from the superiors in position and the
						management with due respect. <br>3. Work according to the
						system of work prevailing in this organization. <br>4.
						Exactitude in work and not slipshod work, causing mistakes and
						misunderstanding, thereby reducing the quality of work. <br>5.
						Efficiency in work, which includes speed, and not haste in work. <br>
						<br>Bharat Sevak Samaj should aim at maintaining discipline
						among its workers. Its rules, its procedure of selection etc
						should be such as to enable it to train its workers into
						systematic, efficient, disciplined and devoted workers for the
						nation. <br> <br> <b>B. Seven Primnciples for
							Full-Time Workers</b> <br> <br>Whereas Bharat Sevak Samaj
						has made considerable progress in the course of its life of about
						a decade in the execution of its programmes, whith the
						co-operation and assistance of its workers, it is felt that time
						has now come when all its full-time workers should follow
						meticulously the following seven principles for advancing The
						objectives of the organisation:- <br> <br>i. No link
						between work and wages its workers. The workers should not be
						allowed to sell their services for remuneration. Instead, they
						should be encouraged to work in the spirit of "Karma Youga" and in
						the interest of the national productivity and welfare of humanity
						in general. In keeping with these priniciples, the work done by
						workers of tjis organization should be completely free and no
						consideration should be paid for the work that they do, neither in
						cash nor in kind, nor in name, fame or any other kind of
						self-satisfation. The motto in this organisation should be
						"Service is Sacrifice". <br>ii. Remunaration should be given
						for the Five needs of life namely, Nutrition, Shelter, Clothing,
						Health and Education, and Miscellaneous Necessities only for the
						worker himself and a limited number of justifiable dependants -
						the present number being not more than three and to the extent to
						which it is not available from other sources. This provision
						should be made because it should be our article of faith that
						every human being has a birth-right over the "Needs of Life" by
						virtue of his being born in this world and not beacuse he is a
						worker or is able to earn in other ways. The workers should be
						discouraged from satisfying their desire beyond the "Needs and
						Necessities" upto the optimum standard as mentioned above, until
						such time as all the human being are able to receive the
						wherewithals for the "Five Needs of Life" in our country at least.
						<br>iii. Obedience to all the rules of the organisation as
						they are in force and as they will be from time. <br>iv.
						Obedience to all lawful instructions from the superiors in
						position and the management with due respect. <br>v. Work
						accourding to the systems of work prevailing in this organisation.
						<br>vi. Exactitude in work, and not slipshod work, causing
						mistakes and misunderstanding, therby reducing the quality of
						work. <br>vii. Efficiency in work, which includes speed, and
						not haste, in work. <br> <br>Bhart Sevak Samaj should
						aim at maintaining discipline among its workers. Its rules, its
						procedure of selection, etc, should be such as to enable its
						workers into systematic, efficient, disciplines, and decoted
						workers for the nation. <br> <br> <b>C. Seven-Point
							Programme for National Defence</b> <br> <br> <b>1.
							Assistance to the families of the Military Personnel</b> <br> <br>i.
						Collections in cash and kind for the purpose of such assistance. <br>ii.
						To arrange visits to families and extend are and help. <br> <br>
						<b>2. Maintenance of the morale and solidarity of the
							community</b> <br> <br>i. To disseminate correct
						information and counteract false rumours. <br>ii. To educate
						the people regarding the situation and its implications. <br>iii.
						To foster unity in the community and to prevent and remove
						tensions. <br>iv. To create a strong sentiment and
						consciousness of responsiblity in every citizen to do his duty to
						the nation transecending all other liyalties and be prepared for
						the necessary sacrifices. <br>v. Taking of pledges for
						self-denial in one form or the other. <br> <br> <b />3.
						To provide construction agency for the needs of Defence </b> <br>
						<br>The Bharat Sevak Samaj Construction Service will create
						special construction corps for taking up construction activity in
						difficult areas for the purpose of Defence. <br> <br> <b>4.
							Assistance in the Prevention of rise in prices</b> <br>i. To set
						up consumer stores and to enlist voluntary workers and to train
						workers for this purpose. <br>ii. To organize active
						vigilance to prevent and combat black-marketing, hoarding,
						profiteering and other mal-practices. <br>iii. Propaganda for
						austerity, restraint on consumption especially in respect of
						imported articles and elimination of waste particularly in regard
						to foodgrains. People to be taught to restrict purchases to the
						barest minimum. <br>iv. Campaign to start through the Lok
						Karya Keshetras and other agencies of the Samaj, for stepping up
						agricultural production to the utmost extent. <br> <br>
						<b>5. Bhart Sevak Dal to render emergency service</b> <br> <br>To
						organize special corps of volunteer to be called the Bharat Sevak
						Dal for rendering service in emergencies and necessary help to the
						community, wherever required and arrange for the necessary
						training and equipment for the purpose. <br> <br>1. To
						Mobilize the savings of the community and to induce people to
						invest in small savings. <br>2. To collaborate and assist the
						various committees that may be formed at the National and other
						levels and with other voluntary organisation in these and similar
						programmes. <br> <br> <b>D. Lok Karya Kshetra</b> <br>
						<br>The Lok Karya Programme, or the public Co-operation
						scheme with the following objectives in view. <br> <br>i.
						To build up the inactive of people and the grouth of local
						leadership. <br>ii. To augment the resources of the people. <br>iii.
						To initiate projects which will increase the capacity of tyhe
						people (Production plants for families) <br>iv. To mobilize
						man-power and resources to increase production, especially of food
						and <br>v. To create an atmosphere and conditions in which
						people's institutions, particularly Co-operatives and panchayats,
						can function effectively. <br> <br>The programme is
						based on the basic assumption that "development" is a matter of
						attitude can be built up slowly but steadly through the subtle
						process of community organization. This involves understanding by
						the people of their own problems and undertaking to solve these in
						their humble way with the help of trained worker who helps asa
						catalytic agent or energizer. It is his part of the job to
						initiate the process and to unrture and develop it to frution. <br>
						<br>The ultimate aim, however, is to bring into full play the
						leadership of the people through their own institutions such as
						the Panchayat and Co-operative, so that an organisation is created
						at the village level which sustains the process initiated by the
						worker. <br> <br> <b>How a Kshetra Works</b> <br> <br>After
						the site for a lok Karya Kshetra has been selected, two full time
						are capable of and willing to render voluntary services for common
						village welfare, and to initiate the process of community
						organization. Usually a rough survey of the villages is also
						conducted. <br> <br>When they have known the area, its
						people, its workers and its leaders a little better, they proceed
						to form the village units and the Kshetra managing committee,
						takes upon himself the responsibility of liiking after the
						day-to-day affairs of the Kshetra. The Kshetra managing committee
						meets once in a month to conduct business. At this time the work
						of the Sahyogis is reviewed, problems of the area in solving which
						the Kshetra has to participate are discussed and important matters
						which the Central and Pradesh Offices point out are considered.
						Under the broad policy laid down, this committee is empowered to
						take any decision with regard to the Kshetra. As and when the need
						arses the committee also constitutes some-committees for special
						purposes. <br> <br>Till such time as a proper Kshetra
						managing committee is formed. An adhoc committee and a convener
						are appointed to perform its functions. <br> <br> <b>Activities</b>
						<br> <br>It is in the nature of the programme that the
						workers cannot initiate ambitious projects. They can undertake
						only small but significant projects which involve little or no
						expense on the part of the people but give them a chance to rub
						their shoulders in a common endeavour. Thus, activities undertaken
						in the Lok Karya Kshetras with the help of the workers can be
						categorized as follows: <br> <br>i. Educational and
						promotional: This aim at making people more plan-conscious and
						plan-minded by holding seminars and study camps on plants, and
						discussions in large and small groups. If the kshetra in a C. D.
						Block, efforts are also made to help the Block personnel in
						motivating people to undertake projects according to the plan of
						the Block. <br>ii. Local project with local resources: These
						include project like the construction or repair of approach roads,
						pavament of village lanes, rapair and construction of village
						wells, constraction of community centres. <br>iii.
						Development of local institutions: Due importance is given to the
						institutions of the village like the Panchayat, the Co-operative
						and School and at a later stage develop organisations for women,
						youth and children. <br>iv. Emergency relief: This includes
						relief activities undertaken during the times of national
						calamities like flood, drought etc. and other accidents which need
						immediate relief. <br> <br> <b>E. Janjagaran</b> <br>
						<br>A wide-spread understanding of the plan is an essential
						stage in its fulfilment. It helps large number of persons to
						appreciate the main lines on which development is expected to
						proceed in the coming years. They will be able to see how progress
						in different directions is interrelated and effort in one field
						strengthen as well as demands efforts in other fields. The plan,
						therefore, is to be carried into every home in language and
						symbols of people and expressed in terms of their common needs and
						problems. The Government machinery alone, however high and mighty,
						cannot expect to do all what is desired to be done in every social
						activity. <br> <br>The primary purpose of the Jan Jagran
						Group is to build up popular enthusiasm for the plan, to inclucate
						national discipline and to mobilize public cooperation to
						implement the plan. The most effective medium for this purpose is
						the human medium. The group, through its whole time and associate
						workers, has been bulding up national network whereby, thrugh
						personal approach, its massage can reach the masses. The group has
						been discharging its responsibilities through(I) District
						Information Organisers(ii) Plan Information Centres and (iii)
						Seminars. The responsibilities of District Information Organizer
